[Correlation Scoring] Scored 246 corners
Small scale (240x376): 246 corners
[Zero Crossing Filter] 8/673 corners passed filter (1.18871%)
After merging: 8 corners
Found 8 corner candidates
Structure recovery with adaptive strictness:
  Energy thresholds: init=0, final=-10 (MATLAB/Sample standard)
  Max processing time: 30s
  1/8 (found: 0, energy_rej: 0, init_fail: 0)
Structure recovery completed:
  Processed: 8/8 corners
  Init failures: 8
  Energy rejected: 0 (thresholds: 0/-10)
  Found: 0 chessboards (sample target: 1)
  Time: 0 ms
  ANALYSIS: No chessboards found - need to further relax energy threshold
Reconstructed 0 chessboards
